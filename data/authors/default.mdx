Hi there! I'm Lomitaswa, a software engineer who enjoys building systems that just work, whether itâ€™s on the web, behind the scenes, or in the cloud.

I work across the stack, focusing on building apps that feel fast, intuitive, and genuinely helpful. I enjoy learning new tools and finding better ways to solve problems.

Outside of work, I unwind with anime, movies, and the occasional Batman moment. Always curious, always exploring.
